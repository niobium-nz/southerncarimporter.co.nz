	        		<h4>The difference between imported vehicles and New Zealand new vehicles?</h4>
					<blockquote>The main difference is some cars have different model names for the Japanese and New Zealand markets. For example a Toyota ‘Corolla’ in NZ is called a Toyota ‘Auris’ in Japan. The FM radio in most Japanese imports can not receive stations in NZ, a band expander will need to be installed. Also some Japanese imports have built-in navigation systems and they will not work in NZ. It is easy and cheaper to install a new navigation system here in NZ than trying to convert them to work with NZ maps.</blockquote>
	        		
	        		<h4>How long does it take to import a car from Japan?</h4>
	        		<blockquote>It usually take between 6 to 8 weeks for the car to arrive in New Zealand after winning the car at auction. We will inform and keep you updated on the whole process as it happens.</blockquote>
	        		
	        		<h4>How can I trust the car is in good condition?</h4>
	        		<blockquote>
	        			<p>We base our buying decision according to the auction report. The auction report can tell a lot about the car as auction houses follow a strict grading system in Japan. Inspection of each individual vehicle is done independently by the auction houses. We recommend grade 4, 4.5 and 5. We would not suggest anything less than a grade 3.5.</p>
	        			<p>We provide you with a translation of the auction report before any bids are placed. It will list any additional sale features or caution notes by the inspector. This report will tell you all the good features such as leather seats, back camera, etc. It will also tell you any issues of rust, dents, scratches, stains, etc. No bids will be placed till we receive confirmation that you are happy with the condition of the car.</p>
	        			<p>As well as full translation of the auction sheet, we will also get one of our independent agents to inspect your car in Japan. This is an additional measure we use to avoid any issues that may have been missed on the auction report. If this inspection result comes back with any concerns or it does not meet your requirements, no bids will be placed. With our expert experience and knowledge combined with those 3 safety checks, we guarantee the condition and compliance of your car!</p>
	        		</blockquote>
	        		
	        		<h4>Do cars from Japan come with genuine correct mileage?</h4>
	        		<blockquote>All imports now have to go through ‘Double Screening’ for the odometer. Every single cars odometer gets independently checked by JVEC before Japanese auctions. The odometer gets another check at the boarder by MAF NZ upon arrival in New Zealand.</blockquote>
	        		
	        		<h4>How do I know the car has all the features I want such as back camera, leather seats, etc?</h4>
	        		<blockquote>You can mention all the features required in the ‘additional comments’ section of the bidding process. We will send you a full translation of the auction report which will include all the additional features of the car you are interested in bidding on.</blockquote>
	        		
	        		<h4>What cars can not be imported into New Zealand?</h4>
	        		<blockquote>Any car between years 1998 to 2004 are not allowed to be imported into NZ because they do not meet NZ Emission Regulations. However some “20yr Classics” or “Special Interest Vehicles” are allowed to be imported.</blockquote>
	        		
	        		<h4>Can I import a car for parts only?</h4>
	        		<blockquote>Yes! Any car can be imported for parts regardless of their age etc.. There is no need to pass or pay for compliance and rego, you just pick up the car from a compliance centre.</blockquote>
	        		
	        		<h4>Can I import a car for farm work?</h4>
	        		<blockquote>Yes! We can help you import any car or truck regardless of their age as there is no need for compliance and rego.</blockquote>
	        		
	        		<h4>Is my car insured?</h4>
	        		<blockquote>Yes, your car is insured all the way from the auction in Japan to compliance in NZ.</blockquote>
	        		
	        		<h4>What import information do I need to provide to get an accurate importing estimate?</h4>
	        		<blockquote>Car year / Mileage / Engine Size / Your budget.</blockquote>
	        		
	        		<h4>Can I place bids on more than one car at a time?</h4>
	        		<blockquote>Yes. You can just add this to the notes when bidding so we will only buy ONE car if you have a few bids running. Once the first car is purchased, we will cancel the other bids.</blockquote>
	        		
	        		<h4>Yes. You can just add this to the notes when bidding so we will only buy ONE car if you have a few bids running. Once the first car is purchased, we will cancel the other bids.</h4>
	        		<blockquote>We require an initial deposit of 70% of the total landed price in order to get the car shipped as soon as possible. This deposit is to cover the car cost, shipping and insurance. The remaining balance of 30% is GST and customs fees which is due on arrival of the boat.</blockquote>
	        		
	        		<h4>Any additional costs on top of ‘Landed Price’?</h4>
	        		<blockquote>The max landed price you see from our online calculator is the total price you pay to get the car landed and complied with 1 year WOF. The registration cost is not included in this price.</blockquote>
	        		
	        		<h4>What happens if the car fails to pass compliance?</h4>
	        		<blockquote>After being in the car importing business, this is the first thing we are ensuring that any car you import through us is compliable under NZ standards.</blockquote>
	        		
	        		<h4>Do you arrange mechanical warranty?</h4>
	        		<blockquote>Yes. We can offer you several policy options for vehicle warranties at discounted rates.</blockquote>
	        		
	        		<h4>Do you do finance?</h4>
	        		<blockquote>Yes. We can arrange finance for you after the car is complied in NZ.</blockquote>
	        		
	        		<h4>Do you provide ‘Trade In’?</h4>
	        		<blockquote>We do accept trade ins. Trade ins on vehicles are at our discretion and we have the right to refuse an offer.</blockquote>
