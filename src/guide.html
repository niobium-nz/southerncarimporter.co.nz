                        <h4>CAR CATALOGUE GUIDE</h4>
                        <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/g1-1.jpg" alt="" /></span>After you get your own auction access, first thing we recommend is to check “CARS CATALOGUE” page to know the chassis ID of the particular model you are looking for. Knowing the chassis ID of a car will effectively speed up your car search in auctions and sales statistics.</p>
                        <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/g2-e1503984042695.jpg" alt="" /></span>The three-letter combination in front of the chassis ID is the car’s emission. Any three letter code means this car complies with NZ emission regulation therefore will comply with NZ standards. <br /><br />Now you have the chassis ID you can start searching the auctions and stats with ease! </p>

                        <h4>AUCTION REPORTS</h4>
                        <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/g3.jpg" alt="" /></span>Cars from Japanese Auctions come with a detailed auction report written up by an independent qualified inspector. The report provides all the important information on the car, as well as its condition. For example Emission code, Rust issues, Panel replaced, Mechanical issues, Damaged interior, Smoker car, scratches and dents on the car. You will receive an English translation of the auction report before any bids are confirmed however we do require a reasonable bid amount before we do any translations.</p>
